It is time to start adding features to the Gemini Simulator.  In this
project you will add a L1 Cache to the design and compare some different cache
designs.  You will be required to design two different kinds of caches and
compare the performance of each.  After this, you will write a small paper to
explain your findings.
    

<h3>Project Implementation</h3>

<h2>Part 1 - Cache!</h2><br style="clear:both">

<pre>  Your first goal will be to make sure you understand the differences between
the possible types of caches.  Refer to <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~prabhu/Tutorial/CACHE/mem_title_2.html">Gurpur Prabhu's tutorials</a> on the 
subject to see some applets that will demonstrate what you need to
implement for the Gemini cache controller.  You will focus on:
    - Direct Mapped (1-way Set Associative)
    - 2-way Set Associative

From the tutorial site, you will see that you need to concern yourself with
code for:
    - Block placement
      This will be two cases you need to test between
      1-way / 2-way set associative

    - Block identification
      You will need to implement a tag system to identify your blocks.
      
    - Block replacement
      You will implement the Random replacement strategy (for ease of
      implementation).
      
    - Interactions with Main Memory
      Read Policy:
        Hit: Simply reads the data from cache.
        Miss: Use No Read Through to store data into the cache every time there
              is a miss.
      Write Policy:
        Hit: Implement Write Back so that the cache will be marked as dirty and
             only updated when needed.
        Miss: Use No Write Allocate to keep the implementation simple.
</pre>

<h3>GUI Modifications</h3>

<pre>You will need to add a field somewhere in the simulator GUI to show you if
the operation resulted in a cache hit or miss.  You will also need a counter
for the total number of cache hits and misses over the course of the programs
life.  For debugging, you might want to consider using the built-in debugger
to see how your algorithm is going.
Another option is to add a log file to your program to see
your progress.  The choice is yours, but the log file might be more useful in
future projects with this...  Consider making a general purpose log class to
make this happen.
</pre>

<h3>Class Modifications</h3>

<pre>The way you implement this cache algorithm is entirely up to you.  I will
give one suggestion to give you some ideas.  You should (of course) modify the
Memory class to include the cache.  If you recall from the original project, we
used an integer array to represent main memory (int Stack[256]).  You can
adjust this to be a struct or class or whatever you feel is best.
Your cache will need to be a struct or class array or some size much smaller
than main memory.  (NOTE: Your cache WILL NOT need to handle the Instruction
Vector (IV)).  Some suggestions to implement the cache- try and override the
offset [] operator for your main memory to make use of the cache directly.  This would
mean that Stack[x] would still work (from the main program in Project 1).
Or create a Stack.at(x) function that will do all the cache work behind the
scenes.  Your Memory class will need to include counters (or pointers into the
Stack class's counters) so that your GUI can access the counters for display.
</pre>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<pre>  For the cache portion of testing, I am providing two sample .s files.
  You will run these .s files through your simulator and you should see
  some vast differences in how they run.  As part of the turn in, you are to
  write a paragraph or so describing your findings.

<h2>Part 2 - Instruction Formatting!</h2><br style="clear:both">

Our Gemini Simulator currently has a serious issue in that it runs
pure Gemini ASM code.  This makes it almost like a lisp machine, and we simply
can't have that...  In this project you will have to make an architectural
decision about *your* Gemini simulator!  At this point, each person in the
class will determine thier own implementation for the simulator.  For this
project, we will create a separate program to assemble the Gemini ASM into
binary instructions for us.  Then we will modify the Gemini simulator to accept
the binary files generated by the assembler and run the programs defined in
them.

<pre>The project data flow is listed here (NOTE: these values are simply examples):

Gemini ASM file (something like test1.s):
main:
  lda #$1       
  add #$1

-- Processed by a new program you write called gasm:
1010000000000001        =  lda #$1
1100000000000001        =  add #$1

-- Binary stored into g.out

./Gemini g.out
-- New Gemini will read binary files and parse them.
</pre>

<pre>Using your knowledge of the different types of ISA's available, you will
determine what type of machine you wish to create.  In general, you may create
a RISC, CISC or a more modern combination of the two out of the Gemini
architecture.  This means that the first thing you need to do is seriously
evaluate the pros and cons for each ISA.  At this point, you may find it
nessecary to change the original Gemini Instruction Set from Project 1 into
something that will work for you.  This is certainly allowed, as long as your
machine can handle the following operations:
(Most of this is as expected.  NEW Instructions you will need to add have a * next
to them)

  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Logical And
  - Logical Or
  - Logical Not
  - Load/Store (You may chose to stay with the Accumulator design, but you are
    allowed to add more registers (up to 4 General Purpose, and any number of
    extra registers))
  - Branching instructions (note that RISC machines will not require a delay
    slot yet- as we have not implemented pipelining!)
    - BA, BE,BL, BG 
    - *BGE, *BLE, *BNE
  - Multiplication (*MUL)
  - Division (*DIV)
  - Subroutines (*JMP, *RET)

Your binary instructions can be formatted any way you choose.  No matter what
implementation you choose, you may find the need to add more instructions than
the ones listed above.
</pre>

<h3>Implementation Choice</h3>
<pre>The goal here is to have the whole class come up with a few different
implementation decisions.  This way, the final project and presentation will be
very interesting and most beneficial for everyone.
I will tell you right now that the final project has to do with adding a 
pipeline or dual core to this machine.  I will wait until the project is assigned to tell
you what exactly I would like to see, but you will be adding to this project
one last time.  What this means is that your decision here will impact your
next project as well.  Here is the general view of what that means based on
your decision:

  - RISC: Will be harder to implement on this project as the assembler will be
    more complex and you may find the need for additional instructions.
    However, as we saw in the SPARC machine, pipelining will be easier than
    with a CISC machine (but not much).

  - CISC: Will be eaiser to implement on this project since our instruction
    format can be anything we want.  However, pipeling this will be far from
    simple making the next project more difficult.

  - Combo: Will be slightly more difficult to implement on this project, but
    slightly eaiser than pure CISC on the next project.

As you can see, none of them are going to get you out of any implementation
difficulty, so its really just a matter of picking one and sticking with it!
</pre>

<h3>GUI Modifications</h3>
<pre>We will only need to add one element to the GUI for this program- just show the
instruction in hex, as well as what the simulator thinks the binary means.
This means that the IR will now be set to the actual binary value, not the
address of that value anymore!  The Instruction: [] should still hold the
'Gamini ASM' text of what this instruction is trying to do.

<h3>Class Modifications</h3>

<pre>You will need to pull code out of your Project 1 (namely the Instruction Parser
Engine (IPE)) to allow your assembler to read Gemini ASM.  The assembler simply
then writes a new file (consider command line options and defaults similar to
what gcc does) with the binary format you decide on.  Once the file is written
out, it will look like simple data (just a bunch of bits).  The assembler is a
stand-alone application that you will run once- think of it as the gas program
that can take pure assembly and convert it into binary.

If you choose RISC, it will be easy to read the file since you just
need to read one word (short int) at a time.

CISC will need an instruction length header in front of each instruction.

Mix will just need to be like CISC with a very defined Instruction Word format
(to be able to split it up into manageable chunks).

You then need to modify the Gemini Simulator to read the binary file you just
created instead of pure strings.  You can still use the Instruction Vector (IV)
to store each instruction if you would like- you should change the data type
from strings to something more suitable for your implementation (a short int
for RISC, keep a string for CISC?).

As the program runs, you should decode each instruction into what it really
means.  Show both the instruction and the decode decision in the GUI.

The next step will be adding the new instructions into your implmentation.
Here are some guidelines:

 MUL / DIV:  You will need to add another register (AccD) to hold the upper
bits result of a MUL or a DIV.

 JMP / RET:  You will need to add another register to hold the return address
(label/line number really) so when a subroutine finishes, it will go back to
where it came from.  So, they can be treated as a BA with a special register
for RET.

 RISC:
  - Branching/Jumping does not require a delay slot!  (We have not pipelined yet)
  - Load/Store does not require any delay stalls either.
  - Retain the ability to move larger values into your Acc!
    lda #$1048576
    No way that will fit in your instruction word, yet it will fit into a register!
    Do what SPARC did here and add a 'set' instruction.
  - MUL and DIV will finish in one cycle in this project, but not project 4.

 CISC:
  - Think about the fact that the instruction can vary in length.  If you can
    implement this successfully, the rest of your code will be much simpler.

Everyone should see page 402 and on to the end of the chapter for some nice
ideas on getting started with instruction formatting!

<h3>Testing</h3>

In addition to the previous .s files,
you will need to run the following code sample through the Gemini simulator.
(You need to manually convert the C code to your Gemini ASM first).
Show the assembler running through the assembly, then show a hexdump of the binary
file the assembler created (run with hexdump <filename>).  Finally, show a
screen shot of the GUI after it has run the binary code.

Code Samples:

Test 1 - Test basic operation

int main(void){
  int x = 0;
  int g = 0x0, h = 0x37, j = 0xad, k = 0xff, l = 0xffff;
  int y = 10;
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; y; i++){
    x += y * i;
    g = h &amp; j &amp; i | k;
    g = !g;
  }
  if(x &amp; 0x02ab00 &gt; y){
    x = 0;
  }
}

<h3>Turn In</h3>

<pre>You will need to turn in the following:
   - Entire Solution (Cleaned of bin/obj)
   - Baseline Gemini ASM code that you might have created.
   - Screen shots of the simulator running both types of cache.
   - Small (less than one page) paper describing your results for Part 1 - Cache.
