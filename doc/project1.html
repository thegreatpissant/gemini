    <h2><img src="image30.gif" width="351" height="88" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3"></h2>
    In this project, we will design a computer simulator based on
the Gemini Microprocessor.  The Gemini microprocessor is intentionally
designed to have as few performance enhancements as possible and have
limited capabilities (Note that this "Gemini" has no relation to Sun's
Chip with the Ultra-SPARC).

The Gemini documentation covers these topics:

<ul>
	<li>Instruction set architecture (programmer's model)</li>

	<li>System architecture (microprogrammer's model)</li>

	<li>Datapath (ALU, registers, and memory) and controller
	  (microprogram, microaddress select, and control signals)</li>

	<li>Timing diagrams for latches and memory</li>
</ul>

<br style="clear:both;" />
Your assignment is to simulate Gemini.  This will give you a
working knowledge of a general Computer Architecture using tools that
you are already very familiar with- at the same time, you get to polish
your programming skills!

Your first goal is to understand the following Gemini Documentation

    <h1>Gemini Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Programmer's Model</h2>
    <br style="clear:both;" />
    <pre>Gemini is an accumulator-based processor with a single bus 
connecting the ALU, the accumulator (ACC) and program counter (PC) 
registers, and main memory.  The bus is used for both address and 
data.  The accumulator is the target of the load, arithmetic and 
logic operations.  It is the source for the store operation. It is 
not affected by branching.  A constant ZERO is used by the load 
instruction, which places the value from memory into the 
accumulator by adding ZERO plus the value into the accumulator. 
ZERO is otherwise inaccessible to the programmer. To clear the 
accumulator to zero, if desired, the programmer must load the 
value zero from memory.

From the programmer's view, Gemini instructions use a 
demultiplexer and a multiplexer to control the target of the 
accumulator, and to select the operand for the machine instruction 
(ZERO for load, the accumulator for arithmetic and logic).                                                      
<img src="image4.gif" width="454" height="258" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3"></pre>
    <h4>Instruction Set</h4>
    <pre>For this Project, Gemini has 12 instructions:

        (Note that $val indicates a memory location
                   #$val indicates an actual value from the text segment)

	- LDA $m	Load the accumulator from a memory location
          LDA #$val     Load the value into the accumulator
	- STA $m	Store the accumulator into a memory location
	- ADD $m	Add the value in memory to the accumulator
	  ADD #$val     Add the value to the accumulator
	- SUB $m	Subtract the value in memory to the accumulator
          SUB #$val     Subtract the value to the accumulator
	- AND $m	Logical "and" of memory and accumulator
          AND #$val     Logical "and" of value and accumulator
	- OR  $m	Logical "or" of memory and accumulator
	  OR  #$val     Logical "or" or value and the accumulator
	- NOTA		Logical "not" of accumulator
        - BA lbl        Always branch to label (goto)
	- BE lbl	Branch to label if operation resulted in 0
	- BL lbl        Branch to label if operation resulted in Negative
        - BG lbl        Branch to label if operation resulted in Positive 
	- NOP           No Operation (Implemented by adding Zero to the ACC)

The instructions have two formats:

	- two bytes (LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, B*, NOP)
	<img src="image6.gif" width="347" height="36" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3">

	- one byte (NOTA)
	<img src="image8.gif" width="174" height="36" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3">

The reserved field in the first byte of the instruction would 
typically be used to extend the Gemini architecture with more 
instructions and/or addressing modes. The temptation of an 
architect to use these bits for unsupported instructions, and the 
ingenuity of users who hunted for and used the unsupported 
instructions, was the bane of early architects, who would drop the 
unsupported instructions only to have the users complain bitterly.</pre>
    <h4>Addressing Modes</h4>
    <pre>Gemini has a single direct-addressing memory mode.  Other 
addressing modes can be constructed by modifying the program in 
memory. This is known as self-modifying code, and was the only way 
to construct many programming constructs in the early days of 
computer architecture that we now take for granted.

Other addressing modes can be encoded in the reserved field, and 
implemented in the microcode.</pre>
    <h4>Memory</h4>
    <pre>Gemini has an eight-bit memory address field.  Thus all code and 
data must fit into a 256 byte main memory.</pre>

    <h3>Microprogrammer's Model</h3>
    <pre>At the microprogrammer's level the programmer's model changes to a 
multiple register machine with the functions of the multiplexer 
and demultiplexer handled by outputing data onto the single bus, 
and latching it into a target register.

The microcontroller and its connection to the ALU, registers, and 
memory are visible.  The architect must write the microcode that 
will cause the eight machine instructions to function correctly.  
As we will see, the Gemini instruction set can be changed by 
revising or adding to the microprogram.
<img src="image9.gif" width="454" height="491" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3"></pre>
    <h4>Datapath</h4>
    <pre>The Gemini datapath necessarily includes the ALU, registers, and 
memory because all share a common bus.  Performance improvements 
start by separating the functions common to the bus to parallelize 
the operation of the processor. (This is why the MAR and MDR are 
included in the internal registers, even though they are not 
needed in this most primitive model.) For example, selecting a 
location in memory and reading or writing memory data could be 
done in parallel during a single clock cycle if:

	- the common bus was split into an internal CPU bus and
	  an external memory bus,

	- the external memory bus was in turn split into an address
	  bus and a data bus, and

	- the MAR was connected to the address bus, and the MDR to
	  the data bus

Some additional control, basically some multiplexers and select 
signals, would be needed to specifiy the direction of data 
transfer on the memory data bus, but the increase in performance 
because of parallel operation is worth the cost in complexity and 
floorspace.</pre>
    <h4>ALU</h4>
    <pre>The ALU performs four arithmetic and logic operations:

	- add
        - sub
	- and
	- or
	- not

The instruction set and all "support" operations, such as 
incrementing the PC, are constructed from these four operations by 
choosing the source of the ALU inputs and the destination of the 
accumulator (ACC) output. Some supporting operations, such as the 
use of the memory address register to select a location in memory, 
do not involve the ALU.</pre>
    <h4>Registers</h4>
    <pre>Gemini has 11 internal registers that are implemented as latches, 
three in the ALU group (A, B, and ACC) and seven in the register 
group (ZERO, ONE, PC, MAR, MDR, TEMP, CC, and IR). Their intended 
purpose is listed below:

	- A:	ALU input, target of ACC, TEMP, MAR, MDR, and PC
	- B:	ALU input, target of ZERO or ONE
	- ACC:	ALU output

	- ZERO:constant zero, used for LDA instruction
	- ONE:	constant one, used to increment PC and MAR
	- PC:	program counter
	- MAR:	memory address register
	- MDR:	memory data register
	- TEMP:temporary ACC storage while updating PC and MAR
	- IR:	instruction register, the source of the starting
			address for each machine instruction's microprogram
	- CC: Condition Code Register
              (-1 for Negative, 0 for Zero, 1 for Positive)
Each register is "addressed" directly by output (.out) and latch 
enable (.latch) control bits in the current microinstruction. Some 
registers' outputs are always enabled, such as the A and B ALU 
inputs, and the instruction register (IR). In these cases there is 
no output control bit in the microinstruction. As mentioned 
previously, the unoptimized version of Gemini does not need the 
MAR and MDR.  They are included for future use (hint, hint :-)</pre>
    <h4>Memory</h4>
    <pre>The 256 byte main memory has internal address and data latches, 
and address decoding. Since we are not designing the memory, we 
will assume an interface protocol that uses the memory address 
register (MAR) to select the memory location, WRITE/not_read and 
DATA/not_address signals to activate the selected location, and 
the memory data register to either provide the data for a store or 
receive the data during a load.

The operation of the memory interface is summarized in the 
following table:

  <blockquote>
    <h3>Microprogrammed Controller</h3>
    <h4>Microcode</h4>
    <pre>The microcode lies at the heart of the microprogrammed controller. 
Control signals for each microinstruction are generated using the 
clock, ø, either for the level-triggered latches in the datapath, 
or the edge-triggered latch in the microcontroller that holds the 
currently executing microinstruction.

The microcode (also known as the microprogram) is a 33-bit wide 
array of 256 microinstructions. It is not at all unusual to have a 
microinstruction width that is not a power of two because there is 
no guarantee that the number of control signals will be a power of 
two, and because floorspace on the CPU is so limited that it would 
be foolish to implement unused bits.

The organization of Gemini and other typical microprograms is 
given in the table below. Is START the beginning or the end of a 
instruction sequence?  Is the glass half empty or half full?  :-)

<img src="image13.gif" width="277" height="392" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3">
</pre>
    <h4>Microinstruction Format</h4>
    <pre>The microinstruction is composed of four groups of control 
signals:

	- ALU group
	- Register group
	- Memory group
	- Controller group

The signals in each group cause a latch to put data onto a bus 
(.out), capture data from the bus (.latch), select a function or 
control a multiplexer, or choose the next microinstruction to 
execute. Most control signals are inactive during microinstruction 
execution, that is, most bits in the microprogram are zeros. 
Active signals are conditioned by the clock, ø, to produce the 
output and latch signals.

<img src="image16.gif" width="440" height="150" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3">

The format of the Gemini microinstruction is called "horizontal 
microcode" because all control signals are represented by a bit in 
the microinstruction. "Vertical microcode" decodes all control 
signals from a microinstruction (useful if many microinstructions 
are repeated in machine instructions).  "Diagonal microcode" 
encodes some fields in the microinstruction but not others, a 
compromise between space and time.  In the Gemini microinstruction 
the ALU functions could be encoded as a pair of bits.

A microinstruction specifies a limited form of parallelism. As 
many events can occur in parallel as there are functional units 
and buses to process and transmit data without conflict. A good 
microprogrammer searches for ways to reorganize the machine 
instruction's microcode so as to extract as much parallelism as 
possible from the microprogrammer's model.  Experience in 
microprogramming can identify the bottlenecks in instruction 
execution that can be overcome by hardware.  Pipelining is the 
easiest of these to see.

It is possible to output data from two sources simultaneously, but 
because some of the same data bits will be zero and one, damaging 
short circuits will almost certainly occur. Sending data to two 
destinations at the same time is permissible if the source of the 
data is powerful enough (i.e., its "fan-out" is large enough).</pre>

  <blockquote>
    <h3>Timing: Where Microcode Meets Hardware</h3>
    <pre>The timing diagram below shows the relationship between the clock, 
ø, and the signals that feedback to control the microcontroller, 
or that are sent from the microcontroller to control the datapath.

<img src="image17.gif" width="466" height="340" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3"></pre>
    <h4>Clock Generator</h4>
    <pre>The system clock provides the "heartbeat" of the microcontroller. 
The clock speed is determined by the time required for data to 
flow through the longest path in the CPU, or by the time required 
to execute the the most time-consuming ALU operation. This kind of 
design is called "synchronous" because all functions are governed 
by a central clock.  Many instructions are slowed down because the 
clock cycle is the maximum necessary in the worst case.  Another 
type of design called "asynchronous" permits the CPU to operate as 
fast as possible for each operation.  Asynchronous operation is 
similar to dataflow processing, but like it, adds complexity to 
the CPU.</pre>
    <h4>Generating the Next MicroPC</h4>
    <pre>First we will examine the operation of the microcontroller.  The 
most significant function it performs is selecting the start of a 
sequence of microinstructions that implement the function of a 
machine instruction, then sequencing through the microinstructions 
until the machine instruction is complete.</pre>
    <h4>Instruction Register (IR)</h4>
    <pre>The instruction register (IR) is the source of the starting 
address for a sequence of microinstructions. However, since there 
are only three bits in the machine instruction's opcode to specify 
the address, it is necessary to translate the 1-of-8 opcodes to 
one of the 256 code addresses.</pre>
    <h4>MicroPC Map Table</h4>
    <pre>The microPC map table translates the opcode in the IR to a 
instruction address. Note on the timing diagram that the IR, 
whose output is always enabled, is translated as soon as the data 
is followed by the latch, but is only guaranteed to be valid after 
the data is latched.  This is still more than enough time for the 
next microinstruction to be enabled out of the code, and be 
present at the current inst latch when the rising edge of the 
clock, ø, signals the end of the executing microinstruction by 
latching the next one.</pre>
    <h4>Action of Carry Flag</h4>
    <pre>The BRC machine instruction uses the technique of "bit forcing" or 
"bit jamming" to select between one of two instruction addresses 
depending on the state of the carry.  This is accomplished by 
wiring the carry into the least significant bit of the microPC map 
table, but ONLY for the entry that translates the BRC opcode into 
the BRC microinstruction address.  Thus, when the carry is zero 
the first of two adjacent microinstructions is executed.  When the 
carry is one, the second of the two adjacent microinstructions is 
executed. Since every microinstruction includes the address of the 
next instruction to be executed, it is easy for the 
microprogrammer to vector one of the microinstructions to the 
appropriate sequence to cause the machine program to branch or to 
fall through to the next instruction.</pre>
    <h4>Selecting the Next Address from the Instruction</h4>
    <pre>As just mentioned, each microinstruction contains the address of 
the next microinstruction to execute.  This is equivalent to 
having a counter register hardwired into the microcontroller. 
While it is space-inefficient, this is also a very fast technique.  
Where the program space is small, as it is in a microprogram, and 
speed is necessary, this is a good design choice.  Larger code 
and more complex sequencing in code may require a microPC 
implemented as a register, with its own set of controller status 
flags.</pre>
    <h4>Current Microinstruction Latch</h4>
    <pre>The current instruction is held in an edge-triggered latch so 
that all control bits are stable throughout the clock cycle. This 
is necessary so that the next microinstruction address will be 
valid when the clock rises at the end of the cycle, latching the 
next microinstruction (see the timing diagram shown earlier).</pre>
    <h4>Generating Control Signals</h4>
    <pre>Most control signals are "and"ed with the clock, ø, to produce 
output/follow and latch signals (see the timing diagram).  Some 
signals are unconditioned, such as the PC.sel, which is thus 
given as much time as possible to "steer" the correct 
microinstruction address into the microcode ROM.</pre>
    <h4>ALU Timing</h4>
    <pre>The ALU is one of the critical paths in Gemini, determining the 
maximum clock rate by the sum of the time needed to output and 
latch the second input (usually to the B register), compute the 
function of the B register and the previously latched A register, 
and latch the output in the accumulator.  If the ALU operates too 
slowly, then a single operation that performs all these actions 
can be split into two, and the clock rate increased, perhaps even 
doubled. Since there are many more data transfer operations than 
ALU operations, the overall result is a much faster CPU.</pre>
    <h4>Register and Memory Timing</h4>
    <pre>External memory is up to ten times slower than internal memory, 
largely due to the resistance and capacitance of the I/O pads on a 
VLSI circuit.  The Gemini architecture, as used in this 
assignment, ignores differences in register and memory timing, 
assuming that both are not only connected to the same bus, but are 
also on the same chip.</pre>

	  <h3>Assignment</h3>
<pre>
	  Now that you understand the basic elements of the Gemini,
here is the software specifications for this project:

</pre>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<pre>
        - The software will take a file name of a file that contains Gemini Assembly constructed
          with newlines (Examples follow).

        - The software will run in a GUI.

	- The program will load the strings from the file 
          and parse the strings one at a time.
	- If a program is invalid in any way, we should quit and tell the user the line number of the failure.
        - If during program execution the simulator notices any problems (namely
	  Segmentation Faults- it should also quit and tell the user the line number of the fault.

	- When a string is parsed by the main programs Engine the following will happen:
	  - Display the string in the simulator window to show the user what instruction is currently running.
	  - Show updates to all registers in the simulator window as the line of code is run.

        - GUI Design:
	  The GUI should look something like the following ascii art:

        -------------------------------------------------------
	|                Gemini Simulator        [ESC to quit]|
	|                                                     |
	|  Instruction Index:  1/30 (0%)                      |
	|  Instruction: [ lda $10                         ]   |
	|                                                     |
	|  Register   |    Value                              |

        |    A        | [ 0x00000000 ]                        |
        |    B        | [ 0x00000000 ]                        |

	|    CC       | [ 0xfffffff1 ]                        |
	|                                                     |
        |  Current Instruction Cycle: 1/9  [Operation]        |
	|  [Space - next cycle]  [Enter - next Instruction]   |
	-------------------------------------------------------

	As each 'cycle' is taking place, the user is required to press
	the spacebar to perform the next cycle.  Pressing the Enter key
	will bring the user to the next instruction.
	Pressing ESC should end the program.

       - When the assembly in the program has finished- we will show nothing as
	 the next instruction- keep the register values in place and simply 
         wait for the user to quit or load a new program.

</pre>
<h3>Classes</h3>
<pre>
	  The software will be divided into the following classes:

	- Instruction Parser Engine
          This class should handle two main items:
	  - Parse assembly files and place them into the Instruction Vector
	  - Parse an individual instruction for the CPU to determine what to 
	    do with it.

	  Since the Instructions are all strings, this class should be
	  very simple (See Memory, Tests for sample asm files).

          Labels: Labels shall be handled a little differently than normal instructions
           (Recall that Labels look something like

            and $10\n
	    lbl:  ! Here's a label!\n
	    or $11\n
	   )

	   To handle this- we will replace any instructions that use lbl with 
	   the index number of the instruction!
           
	   ble lbl
           should end up looking like "ble 1" in our Instruction Vector since it
	   is the second instruction.
           To do this, I recommend keeping 2 lists of instructions that contain 
	   labels and labels/index numbers as you come across them
           (Since we may or may not know where a label 
	   exists in a program as we read it- therefore we might not know the
	   Instruction Vector Index of that label).  So, when you come across ble lbl
	   you will ask your list, do I know what index lbl is?  If not, we push this 
           instruction into out 'unknown instruction list'.  If we do know the
           index, we simply replace the label string name with a number.
           At the end of parsing a program, we re-visit each instruction in our
           unknown list and place the label index number there.  Finally,
	   if there are any unknown instructions left- we cannot run this program!
           Note that having an unused label is just fine.

          
	- Memory
          This class will contain 2 different 'regions' of memory
	  - std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; Text;  // Instruction Vector
	  - int Stack[256];                       // Main Memory

	  The Text string vector will hold lines of Gemini Assembly
	  This will be loaded from a file with each line of assembly delimited
	  with a newline.  Comments (!) and pointless whitespace should be 
          ignored.  Here is an example:

            ! Ignore this comment\n
	    add #$10        ! Add 10 to the accumulator\n
            \n
	    and $10        ! And memory address 10 with the accumulator\n
            nop\n
	    lda #$10\n

          In this case, the instruction vector will look like this:

	  Text.at(0) = "add #$10"
	  Text.at(1) = "and $10"
          Text.at(2) = "nop"
	  Text.at(3) = "lda #$10"

          Note that Main Memory (Stack[]) should handle segmentation faults
	  As in Accessing Stack[256] should fail, but not break your program.

        - CPU
	  (Held in CPU.cpp, defined in CPU.h)
          This class will be the master CPU class and will hold the following:
          ALU
	  Registers

	  The ALU will be the code actually performing:
	   add (nop)
           sub
           and
           or
	   not
 
	  And will track the code for all memory operations:
           lda
           sta
           b*

	 Registers will simply be int values for all 10 internal registers.
 
         The CPU will also record operations it has performed
	   Addition
           Subtraction
           And
	   Or
           Not
           Store
	   Move
         And the overall number of operations it has performed.  Note how each
         Instruction takes a certain number of operations.  You will need to 
         have the CPU determine how many operations an instruction will take.
	 The CPU should also keep an overall counter of number of operations it has performed.

         * We will cover each instruction in class and discuss implementation options for them.

        - Main Program... (Gemini.cpp / .h)
 
   The Class Layout should be as follows:

   Main
     - Contains the GUI code
     - Contains the CPU
       Needed:
	 - public access to all register values
	 - int currentOperationNum()    Tell the GUI what the CPU is doing currently
         - string currentOperation()
	 - int getCurrentInstructionNumber()  To interface with memory
         - int getCurrentOperationCount()  How many total operations have we done?
     - Contains a pointer to Memory
       Needed: 
	 - int getInstructionCount()  (for top progress info)
         - string getInstruction()
   CPU 
     - Contains the IPR to parse Instructions
     - Contains Memory
   IPR
     - Contains a pointer to Memory to fill the Instruction Vector
   Memory
     - Contains the primitaves for memory access

<h3>Project Steps</h3>
<pre>
Here is how I recommend building this software- you can take whatever approach
you prefer as this is an open project- just remember that the final results
must operate as required!

       Step 1:   Make sure you understand how to update the GUI and process input from the user.

       Step 2:  Create the IPR Class and make small tests to read instructions
        from a file and get them to the screen.  Ensure that your
        IPR can handle invalid instructions, comments and whitespace.

       Step 3:  Create the Memory class and make your IPR interface with it to 
        fill the Instruction Vector with instructions- then print them out.

       Step 4:  Create the CPU class which will contain logic for the Gemini CPU
	ALU and memory operations.  Remember from the GUI that we need to track
        operations and operation counts.
        Your CPU class should then contain the IPR and be able to actually run
        code.

       Step 5: Link the CPU/Memory classes with your GUI to complete this project.

<h3>Tests</h3>
<pre>
  You should create tests for your program to see how it operates throughout the
build process.  However, the program must pass these final tests and you will be
required to answer the questions about the tests.

Test 1 - Instruction Examination
<a href="test1.s">Download test1.s</a>
<pre>
	 main:
	   lda #$1
	   sta $0     ! 1 into Stack[0]
	   sta $255   ! 1 into Stack[255]

	   add $0     ! 2 in ACC
           
	   lda $0
           sub $0     ! 0 in ACC

	   lda $0
	   and $255   ! 1 & 1 is 1 in ACC

           lda #$0
           or $0      ! 1 | 0 is 1 in ACC
 
           lda #$0
           nota       ! !0 in ACC

	   nop

Test 3 - Basic for() loop
<a href="test3.s">Download test3.s</a>
<pre>

	 main:
           lda $5
           sta #$2       ! x = 5
	   lda #$0       ! for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
	   sta $0        ! i is in Stack[0]
	   lda #$10    
	   sta $1        ! constant 10 pushed to stack
	 check:
           lda $1
	   sub $0
	   bl out        ! 10 - i = Negative for condition to be true
	 luup:
	   lda #$2       ! x
	   add $2        ! x += 2;
	   and #$0       ! x = x & i;
	   ba check
         out:
	   lda #$2       ! X Back into ACC for examination

</pre>
Test 4 - Segmentation Fault
<a href="test4.s">Download test4.s</a>
<pre>

Test 5 - Convert to ASM
<a href="test5.c">Download test5.c</a>

Convert the following C code to Gemini ASM and run it through your simulator.
<pre>
   int main(void){
     int x = 0;
     int y = 4;
     int z = 1;
     for(; x <= 13; x++){  // Possible without ble or bge
       y = x + y - z;
       if(y == 9)
	 goto rehash;
       goto out;
     }
   rehash:
     y = x & z | y;
   out:
     // Place y into the ACC to examine
   }
</pre>
